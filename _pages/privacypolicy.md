### What information we collect
We currently use 3 third party libraries within Summoning Stone to track app usage, in app purchases and errors/crashes. This may change in the future, but where possible, we use paid and secure services so that your information remains anonymous.

#### Bugsnag

This is for capturing crashes and is an important tool that can help us track down and fix issues with the app so that you continue to have a good experience. The kind of imformation collected includes, but is not limited to:

- Time and date of crash
- Device details such as OS version, make and model, and screen size.
- App details such as version number.
- A crash log. These can include events triggered by you while using the app and is used to help determine what may have triggered the crash.

If you have any concerns, there's a great article on their website here: (https://www.bugsnag.com/product/security)[https://www.bugsnag.com/product/security]. Alternatively you can check out their privacy policy here: (https://smartbear.com/privacy/)[https://smartbear.com/privacy/]

#### TelemetryDECK

This is for general app usage analytics. We use this to track active user sessions, and pathways you may take throughout the app. What we track in these circumstances is all hard coded. So not every little interaction is captured. We can use this information to determine what are the most or least popular features of this app. This gives us a better understanding of what works and what doesn't and informs our decisions on what to work on next. Even better if you could email us with your suggestions as those carry a lot more weight!

The kinds of things tracked include but aren't limited to:

- Sessions start/end times and length.
- Subscription page views.
- Adding/Removing SFX. 
- Scene and Campaign creation/deletion.

Note that we only track the events themselves, and not the content. We aren't interested in your music choices (as great as they may be) or the artwork you have in your campaigns.

They're a good company and anonymize your data. Check out their privacy policy here: (https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/)[https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/]

#### RevenueCat
Revenuecat takes a lot of work out of implementing in app subscriptions for indie developers like us. It allows us to adjust the offerings and update our copy within the app without needing to submit updates to the store.

It also keeps track of purchases and informs us on how many users are on a trial, vs expired, vs subscribed. Check out their policy here: (https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/)[https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/]


--------

Finally, just want to add that due to how cautious we are with your information, it does mean that there are limits to some of the support we can provide. For example, services like RevenueCat allow us to give free subscriptions for certain users â€” if we have a way to identify them (username/email/phone/unique id). But becuase we don't capture that information, performing such as task is impossible. This just means that we can't give out free subscriptions, track down billing issues or give you an export of your information. In future we may introduce an opt-in identifier that could help with these.

For billing problems you'll need to reach out to Apple.
